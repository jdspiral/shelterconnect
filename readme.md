# ShelterConnect

Working the Social Impact Director for Central Atlanta Progress and the Atlanta Downtown Improvement District, along with several developers, have started a online project called ShelterConnect. The purpose of this project is to help connect homelessness services with those who want to help. The first phase of the project involves making it easier for social workers to find the closest shelter to their current location that currently has beds available.

If this improves shelter use rates by even bed per year, that's a $9,000 annual gain to homelessness services in Atlanta. Improving rates by one percent would add 50 beds -- $450,000 a year in value. We are optimistic we can get more value than that, depending on compliance and additional development over time.
